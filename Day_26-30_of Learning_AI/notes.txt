welcome to my day 26-30 of learning AI
These days I am learning the following topics:
pandas profiling


-->Feature Engineering
--this means to extract the best Feature from the dataset 
--even a poor algorithm can perform very good with the good Features

TYPES:
1-Feature transformation
-->missing values imputation(can be filled or removed)
-->outlier detection
2-Feature construction--making new Features from the data and it depends on the intuition and the experience of the data scientist
3-Feature selection
4--Feature scaling
