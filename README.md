# 100 Days of Learning AI

### Welcome to my 100 Days of Learning AI journey!
This repository is a daily log of my progress as I dive deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science.

The main goal of this challenge is:

-To stay consistent in learning.
-To apply theoretical concepts with hands-on coding.
-To document my progress for others who might be on a similar path.
-To build real-world projects that demonstrate AI concepts.

### Structure of the Repository

Day-wise Folders → Each day has its own folder containing:

-Notes (theory, explanations, and references)
-Python notebooks (.ipynb) with practice and examples
-Small projects or problem solutions

### Topics I’ll Cover

Throughout the 100 days, I’ll cover:

->Mathematics and statistics for AI (Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calculus)
->Python for AI (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
->Data Preprocessing & EDA
->Machine Learning Algorithms
->Deep Learning (Neural Networks, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
->Natural Language Processing (NLP)
->Projects & Case Studies
->Advanced AI topics (Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI, Agentic AI, etc.)

### My Goals

->Build a strong foundation in AI/ML.
->Share daily progress to stay accountable.
->Create a portfolio of projects for future opportunities.
->Inspire others who want to start their AI learning journey.

### Tech Stack

-Languages: Python
-Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
-Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git & GitHub

### Contributions

This is a personal journey, but I welcome suggestions, resources, and feedback.
Feel free to fork the repo and suggest improvements.
