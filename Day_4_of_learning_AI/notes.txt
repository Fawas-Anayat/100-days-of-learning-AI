Welcome to my Day 4/100 of Learning AI
The topics I explored today are:
1..Bayes Theorem
---given by reverend thomas Bayes
---update the probability of an event based on some previous information
Formula:
P(A|B)=(p(B|A)*p(A))/p(B)
where
p(A|B)=update probability
p(A)=initial belief
p(B)=marginal probability
p(B|A)=evidence that supppots the initial belief

Use cases:
-->medical diagnosis
-->spam classification
-->recomendation systems


2..Visualising different statistics functins like:
-Different distributions like normal distribution and uniform distribution
-PDF(probability density function)
-PMF(probability mass function)
-CDF(cumulative distribution function)
