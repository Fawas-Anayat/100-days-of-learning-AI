Welcome to my day 22/100 of learning AI
Today I'll be continuing the EDA as  I was learning from yesterday


bivariate and  Multivariate analysis:
analyzing more than one columns at a time and finding their relation
1.scatterplot(numeical-numeical)...sns.scatterplot(x,y,hue)
2.bar plot(numerical-catagorical) --can also use the boxplot but it depends on the condition
3.displot(numerical-catagorical)
4.heatmap(catagorical-catagorical)
