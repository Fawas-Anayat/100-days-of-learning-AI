Welcome to my day 48/100 of Learning AI  

Today I am Learning the Simple Linear Regression

# Linear regression
- supervised ML algorithm.  
- types - simple LR,Multiplr LR,polynomial LR

## simple LR
- one input and one output feature.  
- data should be sort of linear

stochastic error--which can't be quantified like a person has a bad interview then we can't measure how much bad.  

- due to the stochastic erro the data is often not complete linear instead its sort of linear.  
- LR draws a best fit line in the sort of linear data.
