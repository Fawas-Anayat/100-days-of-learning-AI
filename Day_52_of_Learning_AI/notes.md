welcome to my day 52/100 of Learning AI
Today I am Learning the following topics

# Multiple Regression
 - when there are more than one columns in the features.  
 - extension of the simple LR.  
 - here we find the best fit plane in the 3D and hyperplane in 4D and onwards.

- B1,B2 are weights means that they tell us how much is the role of that particalur column in predicting the output. 
- the Bo is the ouput and it ensures some value when all other paramaters are zero.  

- in the sklearn.datasets we have a class named as the make_regression() using which we can generate the dataset of our choice.  
- use the lr.coeff_ and lr.intercept_ on the lr trained object.
