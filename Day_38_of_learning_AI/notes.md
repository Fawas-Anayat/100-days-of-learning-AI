welcome to my day 38/100 of Learning AI
Today I am learning the following topics

# Handling the mixed data
--mixed data can be:  
---the same column having the numerical as well as the catagorical data.  
---we can split the column to two columns and can shift the data there accordingly.  


# Handling the date and time values
for the columns that have the date datatype we have some important functions of the pandas like:  
-dt.day  
-dt.month  
-dt.week etc  
--->similar operations can be applied on the time columns.
