Welcome to my day 21/100 of learning AI

Today I'll be learning following topics
--Data collection using the Web scrapping
--Understanding the Data

Asking Right Questions--This is is the first Question whenever we get a dataset
following are Questions we should ask..
1.how big the data is ?...df.shape
2.How does the data look like?..df.head or df.sample
3.What is the datatype of the columns...df.info
4.Are there any missing values?..df.isnull().sum
5.How does the data look mathematically?..df.describe
6.Are there any duplicates values?..df.duplicated().sum and can use the drop_duplicate function of the pandas
7.How is the correlation between columns?..df.corr-->This function finds the pearson correlation value i.e between the -1 and the 1..the negative value tells that the inverse correlation and vice versa for the positive correlation.
