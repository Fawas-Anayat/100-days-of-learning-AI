welcome to my day 44/100 of Learning AI  

Today I am learning the following topics.  

there are three types of the missing data.  
1.MCAR-- the data for that place is not collected.  
2.MAR-- the data is not collected for that value intentionally like we can fill the value based on the other values. eg someone hasn't filled the value in the age column.  
3.MNAR-- the values are removed intentionally.  

# iterative imputation/MICE
-multivariate imputation chained equations.   
-its applied on the MNAR.  
-its accurate but slow .
