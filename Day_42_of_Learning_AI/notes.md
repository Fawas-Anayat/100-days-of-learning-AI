welcome to my day 42/100 of Learning AI  

Today I am learning the following topics  

# Random imputation
-select some random numbers from the data and fill the missing values with that random numbers.  
-distribution of the data remains same.  
-covariance in the data is disturbed as we are introducing the randomness in the data .  
-use this technique when we are going to apply this data to the linear models and it won't work well on the tree based algorithms.
