Welcome to my Day 5/100 of learning AI

Today I explored the following key concepts of statisics

---Inferential statisics:that deals with taking a sample from the population and then based on that sample calculates the overall statisics for the whole population

---population parameter:means the actual statisiccal values of the population

---sample statisics:means the estimated values 

---Estimation:means drawing conclusions for the population based on the sample data

following are the types of the Estimation

1.point Estimation:provides a single value as the best guess for a population parameter
For its efficiency we can say that greater the sample size better wil be the Estimation
It can be calculated using methods like MLE,laplace Estimation,wilson Estimation etc
Its limitation is that its not relaible 

2.Interval Estimation:in this method instead of estimating a single value we estimate the the occurenace of that value in an Interval called as the confidence Interval
This is more accurate and relaible Estimation than that of the point Estimation



Apart from above topics I did practice the PDF,PMF,CDF and some other topics of the statisics by visualizing them using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
