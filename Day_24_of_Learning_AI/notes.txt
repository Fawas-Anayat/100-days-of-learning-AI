Welcome to my day 24/100 of learning AI
Today I will be continuing the Pandas as I started yesterday

Fetching the rows on the basis of some condition:
eg==> mask=data['col_name']=='some entity of the col'
mask will condition the boolean series that have the true or false as per the given condition
we can now use it as :
data[mask]===>this is the new dataframe that contain only those rows where the mask is true 
for that specific column
