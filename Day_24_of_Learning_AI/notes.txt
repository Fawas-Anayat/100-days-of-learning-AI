Welcome to my day 24/100 of learning AI
Today I will be continuing the Pandas as I started yesterday

Fetching the rows on the basis of some condition:
eg==> mask=data['col_name']=='some entity of the col'
mask will condition the boolean series that have the true or false as per the given condition
we can now use it as :
data[mask]===>this is the new dataframe that contain only those rows where the mask is true 
for that specific column

==>df.value_counts()-->only on catagorical columns
==>plot()==>create a graph using the pandas
==>sort_values()-->>applicable on both the series and the dataframes ..it gives us the descending order 
by default. if we want the ascending order we have to pass a key word argument as ascending=false 
--> sort also sorts the whole dataframe on the basis of some specific column of the dataframe as follow
df.sort_values(df['col_name'])
--> can also sort on the basis of two columns
