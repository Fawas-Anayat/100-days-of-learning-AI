Welcome to my  Day 8/100 of learning AI
Today I will be exploring the Linear Regression,The most basic machine Learning Model

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most fundamental machine learning algorithms.
It is used for predicting a continuous value (not categories).
Example:
-Predicting house prices based on size.
-Predicting student marks based on study hours.
-Predicting sales based on advertisement spend.

#### Intuition: Fitting the Best Line
The algorithm tries to find a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that best fits the data points.
"Best fit" means:
The line should minimize the distance between actual data points and predicted values.

#### Assumptions of Linear Regression

-Linear regression works well only if certain assumptions are satisfied:
-Linearity – Relationship between X and y should be linear.
-Independence – Observations should be independent.
-Homoscedasticity – Constant variance of errors.
-Normality – Errors (residuals) should be normally distributed.
-No Multicollinearity – Independent variables should not be highly correlated.
