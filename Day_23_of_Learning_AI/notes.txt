Welcome to my day 23/100 of learning AI
Today I am going to learn Pandas in depth and detail. Although I have learnt it before but Now I will be further strenghtning 
my concepts of pandas 
Important functions to remember that are mostly used:
1.df.head()
2.df.tail()
3.df.info()
4.df.size()
5.df.shape ---its not function its an attribute and returns the shape of the dataframe as a tuple
6.df.sample()
7.df.describe()--works only on the numerical columns and returns the statistical analysis of the


How to access certain data columns from the dataframe:
==> for one column write---> df['col name ']
==> for more than one column write ----> df[['col 1 ','col 2']] that is pass the names of the columns as a list


Fetching some rows and columns
iloc is a very powerfull and flexible function used for many purposes as per the needs
df.iloc[1]---> returns the row at index 1
df.iloc[3:6]---> returns the rows having index number 3,4 and 5
df.iloc[1,6,7]--->returns the rows at index number 1 ,6 and 9
df.iloc[row_explanation , col_explanatin]--this way we can access the both rows and columns
