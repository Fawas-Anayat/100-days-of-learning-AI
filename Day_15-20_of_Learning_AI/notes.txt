Welcome to day 15-20/100 of my Learning AI


Over the past few days, I had the opportunity to work on two exciting freelancing-style projects that really pushed my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning.

🔹 Project 1 – Data Cleaning & Processing
I was given 50+ CSV files. My task was to clean them, extract the specific columns requested by the client, and compile everything into a new, well-structured CSV file. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data wrangling, preprocessing, and automation.

🔹 Project 2 – Customer Segmentation & Prediction
Here, I was provided with a dataset and asked to build a model for customer segmentation and prediction.

For segmentation, I applied K-Means Clustering to identify distinct customer groups.

For prediction, I used a Random Forest Classifier to forecast customer behavior.

These projects not only tested my technical skills but also gave me hands-on exposure to solving real-world data challenges—from raw data cleaning to deploying machine learning models.

The journey is getting more exciting each day, and I’m looking forward to exploring deeper into AI, ML, and data science as I move ahead! 🚀

Due to privacy by the client I can't share the source code for these projects
