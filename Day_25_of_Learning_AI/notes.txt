welcome to my day 25/100 of learning AI
Today I'll be continuing my pandas learning as per the yesterday's progress and will cover today the following topics:

-->isin(some_list)--> returns a boolean series that checks whether the item is present in the column or not
-->size()--> counts all the rows(including null values)
-->count()--> counts only the non-null values in a rows
-->merge()--> the similar of the joins in the sql
--> when we apply the groupby() by passing the two columns then we get a multi index series
--> reset_index()--> converts a series to a dataframe when used appropraitely
-->pivot_table()-->just like that of the excel
