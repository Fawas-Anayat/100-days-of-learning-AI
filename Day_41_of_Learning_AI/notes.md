welcome to my day 41/100 of Learning AI  

Today I am learning the following topics.  

# Handling the catagorical missing values

## Most frequent missing imputation
-easy  
-changes the distribution of the data.  
-use when missing values are less then 5%  

## Missing catagory imputation
-when >5% values missing.  
-we create a new catagory named as the missing and put the missing values in that catagory, so that our  ML algorithm get to know that this data is missing.
